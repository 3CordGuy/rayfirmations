## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Type `/rayfirmation` in any Slack channel
2. You'll receive a private message with a random rayfirmation
3. Use the buttons to:
   - **Shuffle**: Get a different quote
   - **Rayfirm**: Share the quote with everyone in the channel

### Statistics

1. Type `/rayfirmation stats` to view usage statistics
2. You'll see:
   - Total number of rayfirmations shared
   - Total number of available quotes in the database
   - Formatted display with emojis and proper formatting

### Adding New Quotes

1. Type `/rayfirmation new` to see instructions
2. Use the format: `/rayfirmation add "Your new quote here"`
3. Example: `/rayfirmation add "You are absolutely amazing!"`
4. The quote will be added to the database if it's unique
5. You'll receive a confirmation message

**Requirements for new quotes:**

- Must be enclosed in quotes
- Cannot be empty
- Must be under 500 characters
- Must be unique (not already in database)

### Response Types

- **Ephemeral**: Initial responses are private to the user
- **In-Channel**: When "Rayfirm" is clicked, the message is shared publicly with italic formatting

## Architecture

- **Cloudflare Workers**: Serverless edge computing
- **Cloudflare KV**: Persistent storage for usage tracking
- **Cloudflare D1**: SQLite database for storing rayfirmations
- **Slack API**: Interactive components and slash commands

## Database Schema

The D1 database contains a single table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quotes (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    text TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    added_by_id TEXT,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

The `added_by_id` field tracks who added each quote:

- `"system"` for the original quotes loaded from the schema
- User ID for quotes added by users via the `/rayfirmation add` command

## Development

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies (if any)
npm install

# Run locally
wrangler dev
```

### Database Management

```bash
# View database contents
wrangler d1 execute rayfirmations-db --command="SELECT * FROM quotes LIMIT 5;"

# View quotes with contributors
wrangler d1 execute rayfirmations-db --command="SELECT text, added_by_id, created_at FROM quotes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;"

# Add new rayfirmation
wrangler d1 execute rayfirmations-db --command="INSERT INTO quotes (text, added_by_id) VALUES ('Your new rayfirmation here!', 'your-user-id');"

# Get total count
wrangler d1 execute rayfirmations-db --command="SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM quotes;"

# Get count by contributor
wrangler d1 execute rayfirmations-db --command="SELECT added_by_id, COUNT(*) as count FROM quotes GROUP BY added_by_id ORDER BY count DESC;"
```
